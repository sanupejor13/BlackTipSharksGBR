## Introduction

_Carcharhinus melanopterus_ (blacktip reef sharks) are an integral species within the coral reef ecosystem and are trending down in numbers that can be seen in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia. For our study consisting of data from the GBR between 2010- 2017 and 2021, we were looking to determine if both temperature and salinity would affect the abundance of blacktip reef sharks as a group and also distinct features between males and females. Furthermore, we desired to look into C. melanopterus potential locational changes through environmental projection modelling.

We determined that there is no statistical significance between these two variables and abundance. However, there was a statistical significance between where males and females prefer to reside in terms of temperature and salinity. This dynamic we see could be due to numerous reasons, some of which are not entirely understood, including season variability and physiological factors that are heavily interdependent on one another. The range in which these sharks were recorded was between 21°C and 31°C, with peak abundance at ~26°C and 34.6 ppt and 36.2 ppt, with peak abundance occurring at 35.4 ppt for both males and females. Finally, through the eReef projection modelling of the years 2012 and 2017, we were able to discover that the most considerable abundance of blacktip reef sharks would occur between the months of June-November, which has the potential to increase due effects of climate change. Overall, the _C.melanopterus_ is a delicate species and requires further consistent, in-depth research to determine on an interdisciplinary level how environmental dynamics affect their overall being. 
 
 ## Research questions
 
How do ocean temperature and salinity within the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) affect the abundance and the location of Carcharhinus melanopterus (blacktip reef sharks)?

How do ocean temperature and salinity of the Great Barrier Reef affect the male and female sharks?

How do temperature and salinity affect the modelling projections habitat range of blacktip reef sharks?
  
## Scope

The project includes 88109 shark recorded in the Great Barrier Reef (18.2871° S, 147.6992°E), with 49913 males and 38196 females detected. Additionally, it was determined that there were 129 latitudinal and longitudinal sites in which the sharks were recorded at between -24.11°S, 152.71° and -13.8°S, 146.55°E. It is vital to note that the time frame for the blacktip reef shark records was from 2010 - 2017 and 2021, with most of the shark detection records collected between 2012, 2013, and 2021.

## Data sets

**Atlas of Living Australia**: Blacktip sharks location, sex, and date of recorded in the GBR

**eReefs GBR4 Hydro**: Daily average ocean temperature and Salanity from each site sharks where recorded at a 18m depth

All data sets where downloaded and managed locally, they can be found in the folder named dataSets

## Notebooks

We have provided 4 notebooks that presents the analysis done. 

1 `Merge_data.ipynb` Notebook used to merge sharks records with the temperture and salinity and delete all records that where outside the GBR and/or have inclomplete information.

2 `Graphs We Will Use In Presentations.ipynb`: Notebook used to create the maps and chats that where presented in the final report.

3 `Statistics.ipynb`: Notebook used to make the a t-test between the average temperature and salinity where male sharks where recorded and female sharks. Also a correlation test of number of sharks seen with the average temperature and salinity.

4 `Distribution of BlacktipSharks.ipynb`: Notbook used to estimate the distribution of blacktip sharks based on the temperature and the salinity in different years.
